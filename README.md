# Intrusion Detection using Multi-Model Decision Trees

To detect network intrusions on the KDD dataset, which comprises a significant amount of network traffic records with diverse types of intrusions, build a multi-model decision tree ensemble is built. The project's objective is to enhance the reliability and effectiveness of network intrusion detection while lowering the percentage of false positives.
The methodology involves data pre-processing, training multiple decision tree models using different subsets of features and hyperparameters, and combining their predictions using a voting mechanism. Also used are techniques for feature selection and weighting to improve the performance of the ensemble.
The ensemble approach can capture more complex and diverse patterns in the data and reduce the variance and bias of the model.

Results of training are visualised below:
